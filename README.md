# EDA_and_Preprocessing_for-Machine-Learning1. Data Exploration


Explore Unique Values: Identify unique values in each feature and determine their counts. Statistical Analysis: Perform basic statistical analysis (mean, median, etc.) on each column. Column Renaming: Rename columns for clarity if necessary.

2. Data Cleaning

Missing and Inappropriate Values: Identify missing or inappropriate values and handle them appropriately. Duplicate Removal: Remove duplicate rows to avoid redundancy. Outlier Detection: Detect and address outliers. Replace Age 0 with NaN: Replace any instance of age 0 with NaN for consistency. Null Value Treatment: Handle null values by removing or replacing them with mean, median, or mode as needed.

3. Data Analysis

Filtering: Filter data to include records with age > 40 and salary < 5000. Chart Plotting: Visualize the relationship between age and salary. Place Count Visualization: Count individuals from each place and represent this distribution visually.

4. Data Encoding

Categorical Encoding: Convert categorical variables to numerical form using one-hot encoding, label encoding, or other techniques suitable for machine learning algorithms.

5. Feature Scaling

Scaling Methods: Apply StandardScaler and MinMaxScaler to normalize features for consistent data distribution.

Requirements

Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-Learn Install the required libraries by running:

Results

The data preprocessing pipeline outputs a clean and normalized dataset, ready for further analysis or model training.
